**Task 10: An Introduction to Decision Trees**

**1. What is a Decision Tree?**

<br/>

A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning for both regression and classification tasks. It creates a hierarchical structure of conditional statements based on features in the dataset to predict outcomes or make decisions.

**2. Types of Tasks Handled by Decision Trees:**
   - **Regression Tasks:** In regression tasks, decision trees predict continuous numeric values. For example, predicting house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, location, etc.
    

   - **Classification Tasks:** In classification tasks, decision trees categorize data into classes or labels. For instance, classifying emails as spam or non-spam based on features like sender, subject, content, etc.

**3. How Decision Trees Work:**
   - **Feature Selection:** The algorithm selects the most important feature at each node based on criteria like information gain or Gini impurity for classification, or reduction in variance for regression.
   - **Splitting:** It then splits the data into subsets based on the selected feature's values, creating branches in the tree.
   - **Recursive Splitting:** This splitting process continues recursively for each subset until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, etc.).
   - **Leaf Nodes:** The final nodes of the tree, called leaf nodes, contain the predicted outcome or class label.
   - **Prediction:** To predict outcomes for new data, the decision tree traverses from the root node down to a leaf node based on the feature values of the input, providing the predicted outcome.

**4. Advantages of Decision Trees:**
   - Easy to interpret and visualize, making them suitable for explaining model decisions.
   - Can handle both numerical and categorical data without requiring feature scaling or transformation.
   - Can capture non-linear relationships between features and target variables.
---
**5. Limitations of Decision Trees:**
   - Prone to overfitting, especially on noisy or complex datasets.
   - May create biased trees towards dominant classes in classification tasks.
   - Not as stable as some other algorithms, as small variations in data can lead to different tree structures.

**6. Conclusion:**

<br>

Decision trees are powerful and versatile algorithms that can be used for regression and classification tasks in machine learning. They provide insights into feature importance and decision-making processes, although they require careful tuning to avoid overfitting and bias issues.
